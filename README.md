# elastic-cli
A command-line interface for Elasticsearch

## Installation

The following installs the program given Go is [installed](https://golang.org/doc/install) and `$GOPATH` is set:
```
go get -u github.com/sinzin91/elastic-cli

Optionally, save yourself some key strokes by renaming the app to `es`:

```
